# Lesson 1.3: Calling Methods with Blocks

### Breaking down a typical method that takes a block as an argument. 

```ruby 
1:  [1, 2, 3].each do |num|
2:    puts num 
3:  end 

[1, 2, 3] # Array object, calling object 

each # method invocation 

do |num| # beginning of block, with block parameter given

puts num # body of block functionality 

end # end of block 
```
# 
## *The block is an argument to the method call.*
