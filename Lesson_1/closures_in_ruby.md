# Lesson 1.2: Closures 
### Closures are a general programming concept allowing programmers to save a "chunk of code" and execute it at a later time. 

- closures bind their surrounding artifacts (variables, methods)
- closures build an enclosure around binding so they can be referenced when the closure is executed. 
#
### Closures are implemented in ruby through: 
- blocks 
- procs (instantiating object from the `Proc` class)
- lambdas
#

### Binding
- Chunk of code retains references to its surrounding artifacts

# Questions
*If closures are just chunks of code that are passed around and invoked, why not just use methods?*

---
*What are considered "artifacts" when discussing a closure's binding?*

---
*How does a closure's binding relate to scope?*
