# Lesson 2.1: Introduction to Testing in Ruby 

This lesson is meant to be a brief overview of basic testing in Ruby.
- We'll focus on the bare essentials of testing syntax by working with command line programs. We'll use the default Ruby testing library, Minitest.

## Why Write Tests?

When beginning to learn to write software, we write tests to prevent regression. 
  - When we make changes, we don't want to manually verify that everything still works. 
    - Write tests to ensure that functionality is maintained amidst changes/updates.

Tests can be written before the particular functionality is implemented or afterward. We often spend time jumping back and forth between implementation and testing code. 

### Focus 
- Testing simple classes
  - Unit testing

Advanced testing tools are built upon this knowledge.
