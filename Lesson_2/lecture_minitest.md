# Lesson 2.3: Lecture: Minitest

## Minitest 
- Ruby's default testing library and is part of Ruby's standard library. 
- Bundled gem
  - shipped with the default Ruby installation
  - maintained outside of the Ruby core team 
  - can be uninstalled if necessary

Minitest uses simpler and more straightforward syntax than RSpec. RSpec is a *Domain Specific Language (DSL)* for writing tests. 

Minitest can use a DSL but can also be used in a way that reads like ordinary Ruby code.
